Festoon is intended to beautify Vim, and defines as many different elements as possible, and bends over backwards to accommodate various syntax and plugins (including VimWiki, NERDtree, Netrw, TwitVim, and Viki).

HTML is given a more subdued sub-colorscheme in order to differentiate it from other text and code within the same file. Header levels are fully supported.

A built-in function is included for toggling from light to dark. You don't have to specify one or the other in VIMRC, you can just change on the fly as your mood or lighting dictates.
