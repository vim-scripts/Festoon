Festoon attempts to create color visual cues for as many different elements as
possible, without becoming a garish eyesore. Festoon should help you more
easily distinguish blocks of text and their meaning, but should also make you
happy (as happy as possible, anyway) staring at Vim for hours on end.

For example, I tried to apply some logic to differentiate header levels, even
though color selections are always somewhat arbitrary, and made the settings
common to HTML, Markdown, ReStructured Text, and the vimwiki plugin.

A more complete guide to the color can be found here:

You will need to save that file and reopen it in gVim in order to read it correctly,
or look at the HTMLized versions online:
